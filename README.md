## How It Works

### **2. Navigation**
- The hamburger icon toggles the side navigation.
- The `Login` button and social media links are easily accessible.

## API Integration

### Wistia API
- The project uses the Wistia API to fetch video content dynamically.
- **Authorization**: Requires an API key for authenticated requests.

**Sample API Request**:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.wistia.com/v1/medias.json', {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}` }
});
```

## Styles and Animations

- **Glow Effect**: Live videos feature a red glowing border and box-shadow.
- **Popup Animation**: The welcome popup slides in with a fade effect.
- **Hover Effects**: Buttons and social icons provide feedback on hover.

### Example CSS for Live Video
```css
.wistia_embed.live-video {
    box-shadow: 0 0 15px 5px rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8);
    border: 2px solid red;
